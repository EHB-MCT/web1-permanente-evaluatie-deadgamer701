                Hi everybody, my name is niko and have studied Industrial ICT at <a
                    href="https://www.gito-tervuren.org/">GITO tervuren</a> where
                they learn you about programming languages used in the industrial bussiness like <a
                    href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, PLC,...
                I started studying this because at a very young age I was fascinated at what people could create
                websites and games with a
                few lines of code, and wanted to become like one of them. At my sixth year at this school, i had done a
                internship at the <a
                    href="https://www.britishschool.be/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA5bz-BRD-ARIsABjT4nhRj0vTOfN33HN5vmvYj_eliCVdH2wcizhJTdDECxmHnc938wXBkdQaAhkKEALw_wcB">British
                    School of Brussels</a>
                at the It sector. Here i helped the teacher with several projects and gotten some hands-on experience.

                So when i have some free, I love to play games. i started out on the nintendo then got a ps3 and ended
                up at a pc where I currently on play.
                my favorite genres to play are FPS (first person shooter) and VR (virtual reality) games. next to that I
                really like any type of zombies-apolypse type games.
                to find out more you can check it out via the gaming page.
