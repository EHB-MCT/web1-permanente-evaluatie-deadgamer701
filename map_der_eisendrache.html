            <p>on this map you have a bow and shield aswell as the ragnarack DG4 specialist weapon from multiplayer you
                can build. the bow can also be upgraded into 4 other bows</p>
            <h4 id="regular_bow">regular bow</h4>
            <p> the regular bow is the first bow you can obtain by feeding the dragon heads zombies by killing them
                right next to them.
                the dragon heads are at 3 places <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the open lower courtyard. after the Castle-door trap</li>
                    <li>In Church/Mission Control area. beneath the clock</li>
                    <li> In the Undercroft near the Aether pyramid</li>
                </ul>
                Once you have fed all 3 dragons the Wrath of the Ancients can be obtained from the Family Crypt located
                between the Church and the Undercroft. The Bow will take up a weapon slot.
            </p>

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make your way to the Castle Door/Gate Keep entrance and locate this symbol. Fire a charged
                        shot
                        of your bow at the symbol to reveal a broken purple arrow on the floor. Pick this broken
                        arrow
                        up.</li>
                    <li>Next go to room underneath Clock Tower in the Trophy Room. downstairs from the courtyard
                        and get
                        a melee kill over the bright purple square on the floor and interact with the urn underneath and
                        it will begin floating in the air.</li>
                    <li>You will need to find all six decapitated keeper skulls around the map now. You can find
                        them at
                        these locations (In order of fastest 1 way route)&colon;
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>On a small wall in front of Mule Kick</li>
                                <li>In the upper courtyard on a window up the stairs leading to the church</li>
                                <li>In the Undercroft Teleporter room inside the sink</li>
                                <li>At the Rocket Pad test site. in the back of a truck</li>
                                <li>Next to the Double Tap Machine. on the broken piece of wall</li>
                                <li>In Living Quarters in Sam's Room inside a toy box</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>Return to the floating urn and there will be 6 skulls inside the purple ritual circle.
                        Create
                        six crawlers using grenades/gobblegums and make them enter the purple ritual circle. The
                        skulls
                        will eat the crawlers.</li>
                    <li>Once 6 crawlers have been eaten you will need to listen for the names of the 3 items the
                        urn-spirit lists. There are 6 possible things he will call out. (If you fail to hear
                        the call
                        outs the first time. shoot the urn with your bow and interact with the urn again to get
                        the urn
                        spirit to repeat itself.)</li>
                    <li>Make your way inside the castle to the room between the church and the living quarters
                        "here".
                        There will be 6 statues with corresponding symbols to the above listed items. You will
                        need to
                        interact with the 3 knights (in the order you were told) to obtain the 3 symbols you will
                        need.
                    </li>
                    <li>You will now need to kill zombies until they drop the 3 symbols you figured before using the
                        statues.</li>
                    <li>Once you have the 3 symbols you require. make your way to the purple circle ritual room
                        and fire
                        your bow at each of the 3 symbols in order.If done correctly the urn will tell you that is
                        the correct sequence and unlock a small purple beam of light in the ground. if you do it
                        wrong
                        and you are still in the ritual room you will be killed by the skulls.</li>
                    <li>Place your arrow inside the purple beam of light and wait a few seconds before picking it up
                        again. The arrow will now be repaired.</li>
                    <li>Take the arrow down to the Underground ritual area and place the arrow inside the corresponding
                        ritual location. You will now need to get roughly 30 kills inside the pyramid square
                        location to
                        fill the arrow up with souls. You will know when this is finished as the arrow will glow
                        white
                        and and audio cue will play. Interact with the arrow and it will go inside the ritual
                        location.
                    </li>
                    <li>After a few seconds you will be able to take the Void Bow from it's corresponding ritual
                        stand.
                    </li>

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make your way to the Clocktower and go to the top of the stairs and you will see [this
                        symbol](link needed) on the wall. Fire a charged shot of your bow at this location to
                        expose the
                        broken Fire arrow.</li>
                    <li>Next go to the Rocket Testing Site and wait for a test launch and stay inside. Once the
                        launch
                        is finished make your way outside as fast as possible and shoot the top if the red glowing rock
                        quickly. This will release a ball of fire above the castle if done correctly.</li>
                    <li>This next step can be quite tricky - You must hit 3 ritual circles with arrows whilst midair
                        from any Wundersphere. Locations&colon;
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In front of the gatehouse/near spawn</li>
                                <li>On the Death Ray</li>
                                <li>Outside the Clocktower If you have hit the circle it will light up orange/red and
                                    you will get an audio cue.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Next get 10 kills inside each circle. Once completed the circles will blast a beam of
                        light into
                        the sky towards the fire ball above the bastion.</li>
                    <li>Go back to Clocktower and hold the interact button on the clock at the top of the
                        clocktower. it
                        will show you an apothicon symbol; this symbol signifies what fireplace you must shoot into for
                        the next step.</li>
                    <li>Next look for ritual circle that is still lit up. This will be where you will start the
                        next
                        step.</li>
                    <li>You will now have to fire an arrow from your bow from one of the lit up previously ritual
                        circles across the map and get it as close as you can to the corresponding fireplace.
                        Wherever
                        your arrow hits it will spawn a small volcano which will allow you to fire another arrow to get
                        closer to the fireplace. You will need to volley arrows from the ritual circle to the
                        fireplace
                        in 4 or less shots. If you do it in 3 shots you will get a Max Ammo reward. If you
                        fail (4+) you
                        will have to wait until the next round to try again.</li>
                    <li>Hold the interactable button on the fireplace when it is lit up to give it your broken fire
                        arrow.</li>
                    <li>Make your way back to the top of the castle and hold the interactable button on the giant ball
                        of fire floating above to the ground. It will float up into the air and explode revealing
                        your
                        newly repaired fire arrow. Pick the arrow up.</li>
                    <li>ake the arrow down to the Underground ritual area and place the arrow inside the corresponding
                        ritual location. You will now need to get roughly 30 kills inside the pyramid square
                        location to
                        fill the arrow up with souls. You will know when this is finished as the arrow will glow
                        white
                        and and audio cue will play. Interact with the arrow and it will go inside the ritual
                        location.
                    </li>
                    <li>after a few seconds you will be able to take the Fire Bow from it's corresponding ritual
                        stand.

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Shoot weather vane at the top of the castle with a charged bow shot and grab the broken arrow
                        that will appear below from the broken wall.</li>
                    <li>Next you will need to shoot and light 3 bonfires on the outside of the map. They can be
                        found&colon;
                        <p>
                            <ul>

                    </li>
                    <li>ou will now need to enter the Undercroft and have Anti-Gravity enabled. once anti-gravity
                        is
                        enabled you will need to wall-run over all five wind symbols on the walls without touching the
                        ground before anti-gravity runs out. If you do this successfully you will hear an audio
                        cue and
                        your bow will progress on the HUD.</li>
                    <li>Next make your way to each of the following urns and charge them up by killing 5 zombies at each
                        of them. Once the urns are charged you will be able to pull and hold a charged shot near
                        the
                        urns and your bow will attract lightning. Fire your now charged lightning arrow again at
                        the
                        bonfires.&colon;</li>
                    <li>Return to top of the castle to the weather vane and hold the interactable button on the blue
                        smoke to begin repairing your broken arrow. Wait a few seconds and pick up the repaired
                        arrow.
                    </li>
                    <li>Take the arrow down to the Underground ritual area and place the arrow inside the corresponding
                        ritual location. You will now need to get roughly 30 kills inside the pyramid square
                        location to

                <ul>
                    <li>Kill a Panzersoldat and Pick up the piece it drops</li>
                    <li>Use the Death Ray trap on the Bastion and look above to find a floating blue piece. Use the
                        corresponding Wundersphere &lpar;Upper Courtyard or the area above Double Tap&rpar; to grab
                        this.

                    <li>Navigate to the Rocket test launch site and wait for the rocket to start test firing. Hit the
                        lever under the stairs.
                        and run back to the Rocket Tunnel inside. Wait a short amount of time near the control
                        panel.
                        and interact with it once the test has ended and the switch is lifted, This will spawn a piece
                        inside the teleporter. Pick this piece up before it despawns.
