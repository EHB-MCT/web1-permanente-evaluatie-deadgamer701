            <p>Like in previous games&sbquo; the Zombies storyline in Call of Duty: Black Ops III is told in an episodic
                format&sbquo;
                starting with the map &quot;Shadows of Evil&quot; &sbquo; after which
                &quot;der eisendrache&quot; &sbquo; &quot;gorod krovi&quot; &sbquo;
                &quot;zetsubou no shima&quot; and finally &quot;revalations&quot;&#8228;
                <br> <br>
                "Shadows of Evil" focuses on a new group of characters: Nero Blackstone&sbquo; Jessica
                fictional Morg City&#8228; Treyarch describes the new characters as "troubled individuals" with

                Rose &sbquo; Jack Vincent and Floyd Campbell &sbquo; who reside in the history of past misdeeds"&#8228;
                The
                four characters
                are thrown into a twisted version of the city&sbquo; overrun by
                zombies&sbquo; and are guided by a mysterious&sbquo; unreliable figure called the Shadowman (Robert
                Picardo)&#8228;

                they attempt
                to prevent the events of the original timeline from ever occurring across the multiverse&#8228; <br>
                Other characters include the leader of Group 935&sbquo; Doctor Ludvig Maxis &sbquo; and his
                daughter
                Samantha&#8228; the last 4 maps feature the original versions of Primis&sbquo; referred
                to as
                Ultimis&sbquo; and reintroduce various minor characters mentioned/featured in previous games&sbquo; <br>
