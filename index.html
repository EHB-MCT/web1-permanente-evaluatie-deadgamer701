            <p>Like in previous games&sbquo; the Zombies storyline in Call of Duty: Black Ops III is told in an episodic
                format&sbquo;
                starting with the map &quot;Shadows of Evil&quot; &sbquo; after which
                &quot;der eisendrache&quot; &sbquo; &quot;gorod krovi&quot; &sbquo;
                &quot;zetsubou no shima&quot; and finally &quot;revalations&quot;.
                <br> <br>
                "Shadows of Evil" focuses on a new group of characters: Nero Blackstone&sbquo; Jessica
                fictional Morg City. Treyarch describes the new characters as "troubled individuals" with
                &quot;a long and sordid history of past misdeeds&quot;.
                Rose &sbquo; Jack Vincent and Floyd Campbell &sbquo; who reside in the history of past misdeeds".
                The
                four characters
                are thrown into a twisted version of the city&sbquo; overrun by
                zombies&sbquo; and are guided by a mysterious&sbquo; unreliable figure called the Shadowman (Robert
                Picardo).
                <br> <br>

                &quot;Shadows of Evil&quot; acts as a prologue that leads into the core storyline&sbquo; focusing on the
                Dimension 63
                version of the original characters: &quot;Tank&quot;Dempsey&sbquo; Nikolai Belinski&sbquo; Takeo
                Masaki and Edward Richtofen &sbquo; who were introduced in the Black Ops II map
                &quot;Origins&quot;&sbquo;
                referred to collectively as Primis.Their story continues from where &quot;Origins&quot; left
                off&sbquo;
                as
                they attempt
                to prevent the events of the original timeline from ever occurring across the multiverse. <br>
                Other characters include the leader of Group 935&sbquo; Doctor Ludvig Maxis &sbquo; and his
                daughter
                Samantha. the last 4 maps feature the original versions of Primis&sbquo; referred
                to as
                Ultimis&sbquo; and reintroduce various minor characters mentioned/featured in previous games&sbquo; <br>
                including Group
                935 scientist Doctor Groph&sbquo; the OSS spy Peter McCain&sbquo; Dr. Maxis'
                assistant Sophia &sbquo; the Ascension Group scientist Gersh&sbquo; as well as introduces the mysterious
                omnipotent
                being Doctor Monty. Robert Picardo also briefly reprises his role from Call of
                Duty:
                Black Ops as United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.
