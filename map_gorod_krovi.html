            <h4 id="power">Power</h4>
            <figcaption>
                To activate the power you must simple locate the power switch in the Dragon command area of the map.
                <br>
                Other than reaching the power switch in the Dragon Control area, the power itself is free to activate
                and extremely easy.

            <h4 id="pack-a-punch">Pack a Punch</h4>
            <p>
                To activate Pack-a-Punch you must first turn on the power. <br>
                After that you must obtain The Dragon Network Controller which is a buildable which is split into 3
                parts. <br>
                To obtain the Dragon Network Controller you must obtain a cylinder for the following Groph Modules, <br>
                activate them&sol;call them in, defend them and eventually they will open to reveal the part: <br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dragon Control&lpar;blue cylinder&rpar;</li>
                <li>Tank Station&lpar;red cylinder&rpar;</li>
                <li>Supply Depot&lpar;yellow cylinder&rpar; </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Once you do all three and obtain the Dragon Network Controller parts, you must take them to Operations
                Bunker and put them into the machine. <br>
                You can now ride the Dragon to Pack-a-Punch for 500 points or call in Groph Modules for power-ups.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Wonder Weapon on Gorod Krovi is the GKZ-45 MK3 aka Raygun Mark 3. <br>
                This is a dual wield weapon which has 3 different types of shots. <br>
                <br>
                The left weapon shoots a yellow ball which slows down Zombies. <br>
                The right weapon shoots a high power,
                concentrated Raygun blast. <br>
                If you shoot the Raygun blast into the yellow ball, they will combine to
                create a Gersch&sol;Apothicon Servant like portal which kills&sol;absorbs Zombies.
            </p>

            <h4 id="shield">Dragon Shield</h4>
            <p>
                The Dragon Shield is a buildable which protects the back of a player, stopping Zombies from being able
                to attack them. <br> It can also be equipped allowing the user to cover their front and to attack the
                Zombies
                with it. <br>

                the Dragon Shield also has a special ability where you can shoot a green fireball that does a lot of
                damage. <br>
                <br>
                to obtain the dragon shield you must find the 3 parts scattered around the map and assemble it at a
                buildable table. <br>
                the parts can be found at&colon;

                In order to upgrade the Dragon Shield, you must first get around 50 kills with your regular Dragon

                one take since you have 3 shots with a shield) and then they will disappear. <br>
                After you do that, go back to Spawn where the challenges&sol;trials grave stones are and look into the
                opened up dead Dragon corpus You will get a pop up that says

                These wings can be achieved by riding the dragon at all 3 platforms and obtaining the Gauntlet of
                Siegfried! <br> It gives you 30% less fire & explosive damages, makes the Dragon cost free and allows
                you to
                teleport to Pack-a-Punch instantly! <br>

                It can be located on the second floor of the Department store. <br>
                It will replace the Valkyrie Helmet or
                Mangler Helmet if you have either equipped.
